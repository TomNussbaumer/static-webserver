# static-webserver

## Purpose

If you are running some flavour of unix on your machine it's quite likely there is already software installed which may function as simple static webserver.

This script helps to start one of them without knowing what's actually installed.

## Usage

```
USAGE: static-webserver.sh port-to-use
```
